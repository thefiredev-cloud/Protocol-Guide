|------|-----------|--------------------------|---------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### F. Communication Patterns

**Protocol-Related Communication**
- [ ] Crew discussed protocol between themselves
- [ ] Crew contacted medical control for guidance

**Quotes Captured** (verbatim, no patient info):
1.
2.
3.

## Post-Call Debrief Questions

Ask these questions during downtime after calls (with crew consent to record):

1. "Walk me through how you made the treatment decisions on that call."

2. "Was there any point where you wanted to look something up but couldn't?"

3. "If you had a perfect protocol tool, would you have used it differently on that call?"

4. "What information, if any, would have been helpful to have faster access to?"

5. "How typical was that call in terms of your protocol usage?"

## Observer Notes

### Do's
- Stay out of the way during patient care
- Ask questions during downtime only
- Thank crew frequently
- Offer to help with non-patient tasks (carrying equipment, holding doors)
- Write observations immediately after calls, not during

### Don'ts
- Never photograph patients or patient information
- Never interfere with patient care
- Never record audio/video during active calls
- Never share patient details in notes or reports
- Never express opinions about treatment decisions

### Safety Reminders
- Stay behind crew on scene entries
- Wear seatbelt in ambulance at all times
- Know location of exits in ambulance
- Follow crew instructions immediately in dangerous situations

---

## Ethical Boundaries

**If asked to help with patient care:**
> "I'm not qualified to provide patient care. How can I help you in a non-clinical way?"

**If crew asks your opinion on treatment:**
> "I'm here to learn from you, not provide input. What's your thinking?"

**If you observe a potential safety issue:**
> Document but do not intervene unless immediate danger to life. Discuss with research supervisor post-shift.

**If patient/family asks who you are:**
> "I'm a researcher studying how EMS professionals use their tools and technology. I'm not recording any patient information."
