## Analysis Plan

### Quantitative Analysis

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Demographic distribution (certification, experience, service type, geography)
   - Current protocol access methods (frequency distribution)
   - Pain point severity scores (means, standard deviations)
   - Feature importance rankings

2. **Segmentation Analysis**
   - Compare responses by experience level (new vs. experienced)
   - Compare responses by geography (urban vs. rural)
   - Compare responses by service type (fire vs. private vs. hospital)

3. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Experience level vs. protocol lookup frequency
   - Geography vs. offline importance
   - Pain points vs. feature priorities

4. **Feature Prioritization Matrix**
   - Rank features by mean importance score
   - Create importance/frequency matrix
   - Identify "must have" vs. "nice to have" threshold

### Qualitative Analysis

1. **Open Response Coding**
   - Code PP2 (frustration stories) for themes
   - Code PP5 (biggest frustration) for top pain points
   - Code O1 (app reviews) for competitive insights
   - Code O2 (open feedback) for unexpected insights

2. **Affinity Diagramming**
   - Group pain points into themes
   - Group feature requests into categories
