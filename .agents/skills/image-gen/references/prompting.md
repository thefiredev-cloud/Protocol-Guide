# Prompting Guide

## Core Principle

> **Describe the scene narratively, don't just list keywords.**

The model understands natural language deeply. A descriptive paragraph produces better results than keyword lists.

## Prompt Structure

```
A [style] [shot type] of [subject], [action/state], in [environment].
[Lighting description]. [Key details/textures]. [Mood/atmosphere].
[Technical specs: aspect ratio, camera, lens].
```

## Photorealistic Scenes

Use photography terminology:

```
A photorealistic close-up portrait of an Australian tradeswoman
with safety glasses pushed up on her forehead and a confident smile.
She's inspecting electrical wiring in a residential switchboard.
The setting is a modern Australian home's meter box area.
Soft natural light from nearby window, highlighting copper wiring.
Shot with 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field.
Professional, competent atmosphere.
```

## Stylized Illustrations

Be explicit about style:

```
A flat vector illustration of a paddle steamer boat on the Murray River,
in a modern minimal style with bold geometric shapes.
Muted earth tones: dusty blue water, sage green eucalyptus trees,
warm ochre riverbank. Clean lines, no gradients.
Suitable for website hero section.
```

## Text in Images

For infographics, diagrams, menus - be EXPLICIT about what text to include:

```
Create an infographic showing the 5 steps of our plumbing service process.
Title: "How We Work"
Step 1: "You Call" - phone icon
Step 2: "We Quote" - clipboard icon
Step 3: "We Schedule" - calendar icon
Step 4: "We Fix" - wrench icon
Step 5: "You Smile" - happy face icon

Style: Clean, modern, professional.
Colors: Teal (#14b8a6) and dark gray (#374151).
White background. Sans-serif typography.
```

## Iterative Refinement

Start broad, then refine in follow-up prompts:

```
Turn 1: "Create a hero image for a Newcastle plumber website.
        Professional tradesperson, modern Australian home."

Turn 2: "Make the tradesperson a woman, add more natural lighting."

Turn 3: "Change the uniform color to navy blue with hi-vis accents."

Turn 4: "Crop tighter on the subject, blur the background more."
```
