# Meta Description Patterns Reference

## Character Limits

| Platform | Desktop | Mobile |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Google Search | 155-160 chars | 120-130 chars |
| Bing | 160 chars | Similar to desktop |
| Social Media (fallback) | Varies | 200+ chars accepted |

**Best Practice**: Aim for 150-160 characters to ensure full display on desktop. First 120 characters are most critical (mobile cutoff).

**Why It Matters**:
- Descriptions influence click-through rate (CTR)
- Truncated descriptions lose persuasive power
- Mobile users see less text
- Google may generate its own if yours is poor

## The Formula

```
[Value Proposition] [Service] in [Location]. [Differentiator]. [Call to Action].
```

**Breakdown**:

1. **Value Proposition** (20-30 chars): What benefit do they get?
   - Fast, Expert, Affordable, Trusted, Licensed, Professional

2. **Service** (20-30 chars): What specific service?
   - emergency plumbing, hot water repairs, drain cleaning

3. **Location** (10-20 chars): Where do you serve?
   - Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, or specific suburb

4. **Differentiator** (30-40 chars): Why choose you?
   - 24/7 service, upfront pricing, same-day service, licensed technicians

5. **Call to Action** (20-30 chars): What should they do?
   - Call [phone], Book online, Get a free quote, Request a callback

**Character Budget**: 20 + 25 + 15 + 35 + 25 + punctuation/spaces = ~150 chars

## Mistakes to Avoid

### Too Generic

❌ **Wrong**: We are a plumbing company in Sydney that offers great service. (71 chars)

✅ **Right**: Fast emergency plumbing in Sydney. Licensed plumbers, 24/7 service, upfront quotes. Call 1300 XXX XXX. (113 chars)

**Why**: Generic descriptions don't compel clicks or differentiate you.

### Keyword Stuffing

❌ **Wrong**: Plumber Sydney plumbing services emergency plumber Sydney 24/7 plumber hot water plumber drain plumber Sydney. (119 chars)

✅ **Right**: Emergency plumber Sydney. Hot water, drains, leaks - 24/7 service. Licensed, upfront pricing. Call 1300 XXX XXX. (123 chars)

**Why**: Repetitive keywords look spammy and hurt readability.

### Missing CTA

❌ **Wrong**: We provide plumbing services in Sydney including hot water repairs, drain clearing, and leak detection. (114 chars)

✅ **Right**: Plumbing services in Sydney. Hot water, drains, leaks. Licensed plumbers, same-day service. Call 1300 XXX XXX for a free quote. (138 chars)

**Why**: No CTA means missed opportunity for action.

### Too Long

❌ **Wrong**: Fast and reliable emergency plumbing services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week throughout the Sydney metropolitan area including all suburbs with licensed and insured master plumbers. (201 chars - truncated)

✅ **Right**: Emergency plumbing Sydney - 24/7 service. Licensed master plumbers, all suburbs, upfront pricing. Call 1300 XXX XXX. (123 chars)

**Why**: Truncation loses key information and CTA.

### No Differentiator

❌ **Wrong**: Plumbing services in Sydney. Hot water, drains, leaks. Call 1300 XXX XXX. (77 chars)

## Testing & Optimization

### A/B Test Variables

Test different versions with:
- **CTA variations**: "Call now" vs "Book online" vs "Get a quote"
- **Differentiator order**: "Licensed, insured" vs "24/7 emergency"
- **Opening hook**: "Fast" vs "Expert" vs "Trusted"
- **Phone vs URL**: Include phone number vs "Visit our website"

### Metrics to Track

Monitor in Google Search Console:
- **Click-through rate (CTR)**: Higher = better description
- **Impressions**: How often you appear
- **Average position**: Where you rank
- **Mobile CTR**: Often differs from desktop

**Good CTR Benchmarks**:
- Position 1: 30-40% CTR
- Position 2-3: 15-25% CTR
- Position 4-10: 5-15% CTR

### When to Rewrite

Rewrite if:
- CTR is below average for your position
- Competitor descriptions look more compelling
- Your services/differentiators have changed
- You're targeting different keywords now
- Mobile traffic dropped (description too long)

## Dynamic Descriptions (Templates)

Use variables for scale:

```javascript
// Service pages
const description = `${adjective} ${service} in ${location}. ${details}. ${differentiator}. Call ${phone} for ${cta}.`;

// Example output:
// "Expert hot water repairs in Sydney. Fix or replace electric, gas & solar systems. Licensed technicians, 1-year warranty. Call 1300 XXX XXX for same-day service."

// Location pages
const description = `Trusted ${trade} in ${suburb}. ${services}. ${differentiator}. Call your local ${trade} on ${phone}.`;

// Example output:
// "Trusted plumber in Bondi. Blocked drains, leaks, hot water, gas fitting. Same-day service, upfront quotes. Call your local plumber on 1300 XXX XXX."
```

## Mobile-First Writing

Since mobile shows fewer characters (120-130), structure descriptions so the most important info comes first:

**Desktop version** (160 chars):
```
Expert hot water repairs in Sydney. Fix or replace electric, gas & solar systems. Licensed technicians, 1-year warranty. Book online or call 1300 XXX XXX.
```

**Mobile cutoff** (130 chars):
```
Expert hot water repairs in Sydney. Fix or replace electric, gas & solar systems. Licensed technicians, 1-year warranty. Book online...
```

**All key info preserved**: Service, location, details, trust builder.
