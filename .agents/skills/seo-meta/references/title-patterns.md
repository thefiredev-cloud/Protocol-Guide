# Title Tag Patterns Reference

## Character Limits

| Platform | Desktop | Mobile |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Google Search | 50-60 chars | ~78 chars (wider display) |
| Bing | 55-60 chars | Similar to desktop |
| Open Graph | 60-70 chars | Varies by platform |
| Twitter Cards | 70 chars | Same as desktop |

**Best Practice**: Keep titles under 60 characters to ensure full display across all platforms.

**Why It Matters**:
- Titles longer than 60 chars get truncated with "..."
- Truncated titles lose impact and may cut off brand name
- Mobile displays more characters but varies by device width

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### "Welcome to..." Pattern

❌ **Wrong**: Welcome to Acme Plumbing - Sydney's Best Plumber (58 chars)
✅ **Right**: Acme Plumbing - Sydney's Trusted Emergency Plumber (58 chars)

**Why it's wrong**: "Welcome to" wastes 11 characters and adds no SEO value.

### Keyword Stuffing

❌ **Wrong**: Plumber Plumbing Plumbers Sydney Emergency Plumber (54 chars)
✅ **Right**: Emergency Plumber Sydney | Acme Plumbing (46 chars)

**Why it's wrong**: Repetitive keywords look spammy and don't improve rankings.

### ALL CAPS

❌ **Wrong**: EMERGENCY PLUMBER SYDNEY | ACME PLUMBING 24/7 (48 chars)
✅ **Right**: Emergency Plumber Sydney | Acme Plumbing 24/7 (48 chars)

**Why it's wrong**: ALL CAPS looks unprofessional and spammy in search results.

### Special Characters / Emojis

❌ **Wrong**: ⚡ Emergency Plumber Sydney ★ Acme Plumbing ★★★ (52 chars)
✅ **Right**: Emergency Plumber Sydney | Acme Plumbing (46 chars)

**Why it's wrong**: Special characters can break in search results and look spammy.

### Generic Titles

❌ **Wrong**: Home | Acme Plumbing (21 chars)
❌ **Wrong**: Services (8 chars)
❌ **Wrong**: Contact (7 chars)

✅ **Right**: Emergency Plumber Sydney | Acme Plumbing (46 chars)

**Why it's wrong**: Generic titles waste ranking opportunity and provide no context.

### Duplicate Titles

❌ **Wrong**: All service pages use "Acme Plumbing - Sydney Plumber"

✅ **Right**: Each page has unique title:
- Hot Water Repairs Sydney | Acme Plumbing
- Blocked Drain Clearing Sydney | Acme Plumbing
- Emergency Leak Repairs Sydney | Acme Plumbing

**Why it's wrong**: Duplicate titles confuse search engines about which page to rank.

## Separator Characters

Common separators and their meanings:

| Separator | Use Case | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `\|` (pipe) | Most common, neutral | Service \| Brand |
| `-` (hyphen) | Subtitle/tagline | Brand - Tagline |
| `:` (colon) | List/explanation | Title: Explanation |
| `•` (bullet) | Visual separation | Service • Location |

**Best Practice**: Use `|` for primary separators, `-` for secondary.

**Example**: `Hot Water Repairs Sydney | Acme Plumbing - 24/7 Emergency`
