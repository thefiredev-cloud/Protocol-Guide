WHAT IS A MASTER AGREEMENT  A Master Agreement is a documented agreement between a vendor and the County which establishes the vendor's capability to perform specified services based on conformance with the County's minimum requirements, agreeing to the County's terms, verification of references/work performance history and other things. The County solicits Master Agreements through a Request for Statement of Qualifications (RFSQ) and interested vendors respond with their Statement of Qualifications (SOQ).    For this solicitation, Master Agreements will be executed with all vendors determined to be qualified thus allowing ACWM to develop a pool of pre-qualified vendors who can be called on to perform as-needed or intermittent work.  When a job comes up, ACWM announces it to the pool of qualified vendors who may then submit a bid on the work.  The qualified vendor with the lowest cost is usually awarded the work using a Work Order which, in most cases, includes a detailed Statement of Work.  The execution of a Master Agreement does not guarantee a vendor any minimum amount of business and the County does not promise, warrant or guarantee that it will utilize any particular vendor's services or any services at all, during the term of the Master Agreement.    WHAT KIND OF WORK IS ACWM LOOKING FOR  The work under this Master Agreement will be performed to support ACWM's Weed Abatement Program which often requires cutting and removal of a considerable amount of dry weeds, brush, neglected landscaping and trees. Potential vendors can be qualified in one or all of three categories of work, depending on their experience, equipment and specialized certification/licensing.  The RFSQ contains more information on the minimum requirements for each category of work.

WHAT IS A MASTER AGREEMENT    A Master Agreement is a documented agreement between a vendor and the County which establishes the vendor's capability to perform specified services based on conformance with the County's minimum requirements, agreeing to the County's terms, verification of references/work performance history and other things.  The County solicits Master Agreements through a Request for Statement of Qualifications (RFSQ) and interested vendors respond with their Statement of Qualifications (SOQ).  For this solicitation, Master Agreements will be executed with all vendors determined to be qualified thus allowing ACWM to develop a pool of prequalified vendors who can be called on to perform as-needed, intermittent or seasonal work.    Work under this Master Agreement will be awarded to vendors in two ways which are through Work Orders and by a set of annual rates supplied by participating vendors.    1.  Work Orders: When a Work Order job comes up, ACWM announces it to the pool of qualified vendors who may then submit a bid on the work.  The qualified vendor with the lowest cost is usually awarded the work.  In most cases, Work Orders include a detailed Statement of Work and a jobsite walkthrough.    2.  Annual Rates:  Each year, qualified vendors will be asked to voluntarily submit rates for certain categories (Service Categories) of work in designated areas within the County.  Vendors may choose which of the available Service Categories and areas they would prefer to work.  As work comes up, vendors with the lowest rates will usually be selected for the work.  When ACWM releases its Annual Request for Rates, it will be accompanied by a complete Statement of Work fully outlining expectations, work locations, anticipated workload, etc.  Vendors' rates will be valid for a period of one year.  It is expected that most of the work awarded under this Master Agreement will be based on the Annual Rates.    The execution of a Master Agreement does not guarantee a vendor any minimum amount of business and the County does not promise, warrant or guarantee that it will utilize any particular vendor's services or any services at all, during the term of the Master Agreement.    WHAT KIND OF WORK IS ACWM LOOKING FOR    The work under this Master Agreement will be performed to support ACWM's Weed Abatement Program which often requires cutting and removal of a considerable amount of dry weeds, brush, neglected landscaping and trees.  Potential vendors can be qualified in one or all of seven categories of work, depending on their experience, equipment and specialized certification/licensing.  The RFSQ contains more information on the minimum requirements for each category of work.    TIMELINES    The RFSQ will be released June 28, 2018, and the initial deadline for submitting SOQs will be July 26, 2018 at 5:00 P.M.  However, ACWM will continue to accept SOQs throughout the term of the Master Agreement.",="98889","WEED AND VEGETATION CONTROL","06/28/2018","Continuous","Jenny Rivas","626-575-5487","JRivas@acwm.lacounty.gov"

PURPOSE AND GOALS    Launching the Academy:  Los Angeles County Public Works is introducing the Leadership Academy to foster greater leadership connectivity and collaboration across the department.  This initiative aims to strengthen leadership skills at all levels within Public Works by offering tailored training programs suited to different leadership stages. (Source: Exhibit A. Scope of Work, Introduction, Pages 1-2)    2.	TRAINING FOCUS:  Initial Phase:  We intend to begin with Advanced Leaders (Managers of Managers and Function Managers) during the initial phase.  This training will provide essential tools and strategies to lead their teams effectively.  Starting with this group allows us to refine the curriculum based on feedback and performance assessments from a smaller, manageable group.  (Source: Exhibit A. Scope of Work, Introduction, Pages 1-2)   Expansion:  Once the program is optimized, it will expand to include the larger group of Foundational Leaders (Self-Managers and Managers of Others), where the broader impact will be felt due to the higher number of participants.  Finally, the program will be introduced to Executive Leaders (Business Managers and Above), focusing on advanced strategies for strategic influence and organizational alignment.  (Source: Exhibit A. Scope of Work, Introduction, Pages 1-2)    3.	CURRICULUM STRUCTURE:  Three Distinct Tracks:  The Leadership Academy features a structured curriculum with three tracks:    o	Foundational Leadership:  Focused on self-managers and managers of others, emphasizing skill-building and practical application.    o	Advanced Leadership:  Targeted at managers of managers and function managers, with a focus on enhancing leadership skills and strategic thinking.    o	Executive Leadership:  Tailored for business managers and above, delving into advanced leadership topics and organizational strategies.    (Source: Exhibit A. Scope of Work, Overview, Page 3 and Training Modules, Page 7)    4.	TRAINING DELIVERY:   Methods:  The program is primarily delivered through in-person training sessions, employing a mix of instructional methods, including lectures, assignments, interactive techniques (e.g., role plays, group discussions), and case studies.  Online platforms may also be used, pending approval.  (Source: Exhibit A. Scope of Work, Work Description, Pages 3-4)    5.	ALIGNMENT WITH COMPETENCIES:  Competency Alignment:  All components of the training program, including course content and learning objectives, will align with the leadership competencies outlined in the Scope of Work attachments.  This ensures that the training is directly relevant to the leadership challenges faced by Public Works.  (Source: Exhibit A. Scope of Work, Work Description, Pages 3-4)     The initial deadline to submit SOQs is Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 5:30 p.m. Please direct your questions to Mr. Sandoval or Ms. Cabrera.
