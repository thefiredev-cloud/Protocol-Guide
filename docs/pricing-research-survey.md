## Analysis Plan

### Van Westendorp Analysis

1. **Collect Data:** Export responses for Q9-Q12
2. **Create Cumulative Distributions:**
   - Too Cheap: % saying price is too cheap at each price point
   - Expensive: % saying price is getting expensive
   - Too Expensive: % saying price is too expensive
   - Good Value: % saying price is a bargain

3. **Plot Intersections:**
   - PMC (Point of Marginal Cheapness): Too Cheap crosses Expensive
   - OPP (Optimal Price Point): Too Cheap crosses Too Expensive
   - IDP (Indifference Price Point): Expensive crosses Good Value
   - PME (Point of Marginal Expensiveness): Too Expensive crosses Good Value

4. **Determine Acceptable Range:**
   - Minimum: PMC
   - Maximum: PME
   - Optimal: Between OPP and IDP

### MaxDiff Analysis

1. **Score Each Feature:**
   - +1 for each "most important" selection
   - -1 for each "least important" selection
   - Sum scores across all respondents

2. **Rank Features:**
   - High positive score = Must-have (include in base tier)
   - Moderate score = Differentiator (use for tiers)
   - Low/negative score = Nice-to-have or cut

### Segment Analysis

Segment responses by:
- Role (paramedic vs EMT vs educator)
- Experience level
- Agency type
- Current user vs non-user

Look for different willingness to pay across segments.
