# Reddit Engagement Strategy for Protocol Guide

> Build authentic presence in EMS subreddits through genuine value-first participation

---

## Executive Summary

Reddit's EMS community represents 400K+ potential users across r/ems, r/NewToEMS, r/Paramedics, and r/firefighting. These communities are highly engaged but extremely skeptical of marketing. Success requires becoming a trusted community member FIRST, then naturally introducing Protocol Guide when genuinely relevant.

**Core Principle**: If it feels like marketing, it will fail. Every interaction must provide genuine value independent of any brand mention.
