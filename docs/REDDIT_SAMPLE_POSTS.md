### Post 1: NREMT Study Guide (r/NewToEMS)

**Title**: Comprehensive NREMT-B Study Guide - Section by Section Breakdown [2026]

**Body**:
```
Hey everyone,

Compiled this from dozens of recent test-taker experiences and current NREMT
content outlines. Hopefully this helps someone.

---

## How the NREMT Works

- Computer adaptive test (CAT)
- 70-120 questions (stops when competency is determined)
- No penalty for wrong answers
- You cannot go back to previous questions

---

## Section Breakdown

### Airway, Respiration, Ventilation (18-22% of exam)

**What They Actually Test:**

| Topic | What to Know |
|-------|--------------|
| BVM Ventilation | Rate, seal, troubleshooting |
| Oxygen Devices | NC, NRB, BVM - when to use each |
| Airway Adjuncts | OPA/NPA sizing and contraindications |
| Suctioning | Technique, duration limits |

**High-Yield Points:**
- BVM ventilation rate: 10-12/min for adults (NOT hyperventilate)
- OPA sizing: corner of mouth to angle of jaw
- NPA contraindicated in: basilar skull fracture (raccoon eyes, Battle's sign)
- Always have suction ready when managing airway

**Study Focus:** They love questions about recognizing when ventilation is
adequate vs inadequate. Know the signs of effective BVM use.

---

### Cardiology and Resuscitation (20-24% of exam)

**What They Actually Test:**

| Topic | What to Know |
|-------|--------------|
| Cardiac Arrest | CPR quality, AED use, team dynamics |
| ACS Recognition | STEMI symptoms, atypical presentations |
| Shock Types | Recognition and initial treatment |
| Vital Signs | Normal ranges by age group |

**High-Yield Points:**
- Compression rate: 100-120/min
- Compression depth: 2-2.4 inches (adult)
- AED - shock as soon as indicated, minimize interruptions
- Nitroglycerin contraindications: SBP <100, recent ED meds, right-sided MI

**Study Focus:** NREMT loves asking about what to do when AED says "no shock
advised" - answer is always CPR.

---

### Trauma (14-18% of exam)

**What They Actually Test:**

| Topic | What to Know |
|-------|--------------|
| Mechanism of Injury | High vs low energy, significant MOI |
| Bleeding Control | Direct pressure, tourniquets, packing |
| Spinal Motion Restriction | When to use, proper technique |
| Splinting | General principles |

**High-Yield Points:**
- Life-threatening bleeding: tourniquet high and tight
- Significant MOI triggers full assessment + SMR consideration
- Open chest wound: seal on 3 sides (or commercial device)
- Impaled object: stabilize in place, don't remove

**Study Focus:** They test decision-making more than skills. Know WHEN to do
something, not just how.

---

### Medical Emergencies (27-31% of exam)

**What They Actually Test:**

| Topic | What to Know |
|-------|--------------|
| Diabetic Emergencies | Hypo vs hyperglycemia, treatment |
| Stroke | Recognition (FAST), transport priority |
| Allergic Reactions | Anaphylaxis signs, epi indications |
| Overdose/Poisoning | Common presentations, narcan |
| Respiratory Emergencies | Asthma, COPD, CHF differentiation |

**High-Yield Points:**
- Hypoglycemia: altered mental status + low glucose = give sugar
- Stroke: note time of symptom onset, rapid transport
- Anaphylaxis: epi IM lateral thigh, can repeat in 5-10 min
- Asthma: albuterol; COPD: same but watch O2; CHF: position of comfort

**Study Focus:** This is the biggest section. Focus on recognition and
appropriate treatment for common presentations.

---

### EMS Operations (10-14% of exam)

**What They Actually Test:**

| Topic | What to Know |
|-------|--------------|
| Scene Safety | BSI, scene assessment |
| MCI Triage | START triage categories |
| Lifting/Moving | Proper body mechanics, emergency moves |
| Documentation | What to document, legal considerations |

**High-Yield Points:**
- START triage: walking = green, breathing after positioning = yellow,
  following commands = yellow, otherwise = red or black
- Emergency moves only for immediate danger
- Document objectively, no opinions

## Helpful Comment Examples

### Example 1: Answering a Protocol Question

**Thread**: "What's the epi dose for anaphylaxis again?"

**Response**:
```
Standard adult dose is 0.3mg (0.3mL of 1:1000) IM, usually anterolateral thigh.

For peds, it's typically 0.01mg/kg up to 0.3mg max - most protocols have
weight-based charts or use 0.15mg for kids under ~30kg.

Can repeat every 5-10 minutes if symptoms persist and patient remains
hypotensive or has severe respiratory distress.

Key things to remember:
- IM, not SubQ (faster absorption)
- Lateral thigh preferred (can go through clothing if needed)
- Auto-injectors are IM and work fine

Check your specific protocols though - there's some variation on repeat
dosing intervals.

What state are you in? Happy to point you to your specific guidelines.

### Example 2: NREMT Study Question

**Thread**: "Keep getting shock questions wrong - help?"

**Response**:
```
Shock questions trip up a lot of people. Here's how to think through them:

**NREMT wants you to recognize the TYPE of shock first:**

| Type | Cause | Key Findings |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Hypovolemic | Blood/fluid loss | Trauma, tachycardia, weak pulse |
| Cardiogenic | Pump failure | JVD, crackles, cardiac history |
| Distributive | Vasodilation | Warm skin (anaphylaxis, sepsis) |
| Obstructive | Physical blockage | Tension pneumo, tamponade |

**What they usually test:**

1. Can you identify early vs late shock?
   - Early: Tachycardia, anxiety, delayed cap refill
   - Late: Hypotension, altered mental status

2. Do you know basic treatment priorities?
   - Control bleeding (if applicable)
   - Position appropriately
   - High-flow O2
   - Prevent heat loss
   - Rapid transport

3. Can you differentiate shock types from scenario clues?

**Study tip:** Make a table with scenarios and practice categorizing. Like:
- "Patient stung by bee, hives, hypotensive, wheezing" = Anaphylactic (distributive)
- "GSW to abdomen, rapid pulse, cold skin" = Hypovolemic
- "Chest pain, SOB, JVD, crackles" = Cardiogenic

The more scenarios you work through, the faster you'll recognize patterns.

Need more practice scenarios? Happy to throw some your way.

### Example 3: Career Advice

**Thread**: "Is EMS worth it? Just got accepted to EMT school"

**Response**:
```
Honest take after [X] years:

**The good:**
- You will help people on their worst days. That matters.
- Skills you learn transfer everywhere (nursing, PA, fire, etc.)
- Every shift is different
- The crew bonds are real
- You'll see things most people never will

**The challenging:**
- Pay is often not great (depends heavily on your system)
- Schedule can be brutal on relationships/health
- Burnout is real and common
- Some calls will stick with you
- The system can be frustrating

**My honest advice:**

1. **Go in with realistic expectations.** It's not like TV. Most calls are
   not emergencies. But when they are, you need to perform.

2. **Treat EMT as a stepping stone OR a career** - both are valid. Many use
   it to get patient care hours for nursing/PA school. Others make a career
   of it. Neither is wrong.

3. **Your agency matters more than anything.** A good agency with fair pay,
   reasonable call volume, and supportive leadership makes all the
   difference. A toxic system will burn you out in a year.

4. **Take care of your mental health.** Find outlets. Talk to people. Don't
   pretend you're fine when you're not.

5. **Keep learning.** The best providers are always students. Read, take
   classes, ask questions.

**Is it worth it?** For me, yes. I've been in codes where we got ROSC and
the patient walked out of the hospital. I've held hands with people in their
final moments. I've talked people through the worst days of their lives.
That means something.

But you have to go in knowing what you're signing up for.

Feel free to DM if you want to talk through specifics.

### Example 4: When Someone Asks About Apps

**Thread**: "What apps do you guys use on shift?"

**Response**:
```
Here's what I've seen people use:

**Protocol Reference:**
- PDF of state protocols on phone (free, works offline)
- Protocol Guide (disclosure: I work here) - natural language search,
  55K+ protocols. Free tier for basic lookups.
- Paramedic Protocol Provider - good state-specific content
- Your agency's app if they have one

**Medications:**
- Epocrates (free version is solid)
- Medscape
- Lexicomp (if your agency has subscription)

**Cardiac:**
- Some people use 12-lead interpretation apps
- AHA ACLS/PALS apps

**Other:**
- Scanner apps for documentation backup
- Mapping apps for addresses
- Google Translate for language barriers

What specifically are you trying to solve? Different tools for different needs.
```

### Example 5: Responding to App Criticism

**Thread**: Someone says "Protocol Guide search sucks for [specific thing]"

**Response**:
```
Appreciate the honest feedback - this is exactly what we need to hear.

You're right that [specific issue] doesn't work well right now. We've heard
similar feedback from others.

A few questions to help us fix this:

1. When you searched for [thing], what were you expecting to find?
2. What did come up instead?
3. Are you looking for [specific protocol type] or something else?

Adding this to the roadmap. I'll follow up here when we push a fix.

In the meantime, for [their use case], you might have better luck with
[alternative approach or competitor].
